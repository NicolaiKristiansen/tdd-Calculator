I have added four functions.

* One is for adding int together
* The 2nd is for subtracting numbers
* The third is for multiplying numbers together
* The fourth is for dividing

I have made changes to the first function and two new versions now exist

* One version can take a String of numbers written like so "2,3" and add them together
* The other version will use an int array and calculate the total sum of the numbers in the array
